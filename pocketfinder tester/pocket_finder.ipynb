    "\n",
    "## Principle\n",
    "Instead of computing expensive energy functions, the protein surface is sampled geometrically:\n",
    "1. A 3D grid of points is placed over the entire protein\n",
    "2. Points that are too close to the protein (collision) or too far away (empty space) are removed\n",
    "3. The remaining points — located inside cavities and pockets — are grouped into clusters\n",
    "4. Each cluster corresponds to one potential binding pocket\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "A `.pdb` file (here: `1H8D.pdb` — a kinase from the RCSB Protein Data Bank)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Short-term (easy to implement)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Rank pockets by volume instead of point count**\n",
    "The largest pocket is not always the biologically most relevant one. Volume can be estimated as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "volume_A3 = len(pocket_points) * spacing**3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Adapt `min_dist` to per-element Van der Waals radii**\n",
    "Currently `min_dist=2.5 Å` is uniform for all atoms. A more realistic approach:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "VDW_RADII = {'C': 1.7, 'N': 1.55, 'O': 1.52, 'S': 1.8}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Configuration file / argparse**\n",
    "Parameters like `spacing`, `min_dist`, `max_dist` should not be hardcoded.\n",
    "They should be passed via CLI arguments or a `.yaml` config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mid-term (higher impact)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Use only model 0**\n",
    "NMR structures in PDB files contain multiple models (conformers).\n",
    "Currently the code iterates over all models and accumulates atoms from all of them. Better:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = structure[0]  # Use only the first model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Use B-factors as a flexibility filter**\n",
    "Atoms with a high B-factor (> 60) are highly flexible and do not define a stable pocket.\n",
    "These atoms could be excluded from the KDTree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Compute a depth score (SAS-based)**\n",
    "A point surrounded by many atoms lies deeper inside a pocket.\n",
    "This can be measured by the number of neighbors in the KDTree:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "depth_score = tree.query_ball_point(point, max_dist, return_length=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Validate against the known binding site**\n",
    "For `1H8D` the real ligand is known. You could check whether Pocket #0 actually\n",
    "overlaps with the ligand coordinates from the PDB — that would be a real quality test.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term (research project)\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Integrate additional scoring functions**\n",
    "- Hydrophobicity of surrounding residues (Ala, Val, Leu, Ile → high score)\n",
    "- Conservation of pocket residues (via MSA / ConSurf)\n",
    "- Benchmarking against `fpocket`, `SiteMap`, or `AutoSite`\n",
