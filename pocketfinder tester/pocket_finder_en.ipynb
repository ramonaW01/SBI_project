    "This notebook implements a geometry-based algorithm for predicting **ligand binding pockets** in protein structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principle\n",
    "Instead of computing expensive energy functions, the protein surface is sampled geometrically:\n",
    "1. A 3D grid of points is placed over the entire protein\n",
    "2. Points that are too close to the protein (collision) or too far away (empty space) are removed\n",
    "3. The remaining points — located inside cavities and pockets — are grouped into clusters\n",
    "4. Each cluster corresponds to one potential binding pocket\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "A `.pdb` file (here: `1H8D.pdb` — a kinase from the RCSB Protein Data Bank)\n",
